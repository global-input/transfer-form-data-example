## Transfer Form Data Across Devices
This is an example React application that uses [the ReactJS library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to implement mobile integration that allows users to use mobile to transfer form data across applications running on other devices

You may download the example and run the following command.
```
   yarn start
```
Alternative, you may also try the [live running instance of this application](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/form-data-transfer). 
   
There is also [a simpler example](https://github.com/global-input/content-transfer-example) for you to get started with [the ReactJS library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react)
